    <h1>The Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the efficient execution of an algorithm as input size grows. It quantifies the number of operations an algorithm performs, indicating its efficiency for larger problems.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> gauges the memory efficiency of an algorithm as input grows. It quantifies the additional memory required for execution, often denoted as O(n) in relation to input size.</p>
